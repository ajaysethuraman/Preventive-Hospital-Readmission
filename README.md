This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict patient readmissions within a specified time frame after discharge. It aims to assist healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients and implementing preventative measures to improve outcomes. The provided code implements a pipeline for predicting hospital readmission within 30 days using machine learning techniques. Here's a structured breakdown of its purpose and functionality:

Objective
- The goal is to build predictive models to identify patients at high risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge, enabling preventive measures to be taken.

Key Steps in the Code
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Data Import: Loads the diabetic_data.csv dataset containing hospital records.
- Filtering Data: Removes rows with specific discharge_disposition_id values (like patients who expired or left against medical advice).
- Label Creation:
  - Generates a binary output label (OUTPUT_LABEL), where:
    - 1 = Readmitted within 30 days (readmitted == '<30')
    - 0 = Not readmitted within 30 days.
  - Calculates prevalence to identify the proportion of positive cases.

2. Data Cleaning
- Missing Values:
  - Replaces ? with NaN.
  - Fills missing values in specific columns (race, payer_code, medical_specialty) with 'UNK'.
- Feature Engineering:
  - Groups rare categories in medical_specialty into an 'Other' class.
  - Encodes age into numerical groups (e.g., [0-10) â†’ 0).
  - Creates a binary feature has_weight indicating whether weight is available.
  - Converts categorical columns into one-hot encoded features using pd.get_dummies.

3. Splitting the Data
- Divides the data into train, validation, and test sets:
  - 70% for training, and the remaining 30% split equally between validation and test sets.
- Balances the training set by undersampling the majority class.

4. Feature Standardization
- Normalizes numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure all features are on a similar scale.

5. Modeling
- Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated:

  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Logistic Regression (LR)
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
  - Naive Bayes (NB)
  - Decision Tree (DT)
  - Random Forest (RF)
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)

6. Performance Metrics
- Each model's performance is evaluated on:

  - AUC (Area Under the Curve): Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity: Provide additional insights into model behavior.
  - Prevalence: Ensures the models are calibrated to the real-world distribution.

7. Output and Results
- The results for each model (on training and validation sets) are compiled into a df_results DataFrame for comparison.
- The top-performing models based on AUC, recall, and specificity can be selected for further deployment.

8. Real-World Application
- This pipeline is designed to:
  - Flag High-Risk Patients: Predict which patients are likely to be readmitted within 30 days.
  - Optimize Resource Allocation: Enable hospitals to focus resources on at-risk patients.
  - Improve Patient Outcomes: By identifying high-risk patients early, interventions like post-discharge follow-ups can be implemented.
